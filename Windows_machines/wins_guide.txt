## This is for the windows targets:
Ports to pay attention:
445 SMB
389 LDAP
1433 MSSQL

normally you will get some creds for win machines.
You should try them to find what they are for

1) netexec ldap <targetIP> -u <username> -p <password>
and you will get smb and ldap confirmation

2) nxc smb <TargetIP> -u '<username>' -p '<password>' --shares
and you getw all the smb shares

3) crackmapexec smb <targetIP> -u <username> -p <password> --users or --computers

and now you get the info you wanted:

1) smbclient -L //targetip -U <username>
and then
2) smbclient //targetip -U <username>
>ls
and you get the files
3)

Then use bloodhund to find the connections and then use impacet tools.
