First open the code and look for some logic mistakes 
Then try some sqli 
if you have the code, try to find some mistakes (chatgtp,deepseek). If you find something try to abuse it with burp (some JWT token?)



1) open burp
2) catch a request with random creds
3) you can play with the creds for a while
4) save this items with right click and save... named sql
5) --> sqlmap -r sql --batch  (for a vulner scan)
    a) Is vulnerable to sqli? then dump the database:--> sqlmap -r sql --batch -D main -T user --dump  (*it might take some time*)
      Your target are the hashes (usually md5's) or emails of the user/admin. Go to https://crackstation.net/ to crack it :)
    b) is not vulnerable?
6) after you got the creds and log in, search for exploits maybe



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
at burp POST try:
POST /login?--env=dev HTTP/1.1

you can try other names for env like : preprod,testing
